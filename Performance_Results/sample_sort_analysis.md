# Sample Sort Performance Analysis

## Test Configuration
- Date: Mon May 12 10:07:12 PM EEST 2025
- Number of processes: 8
- Each test averaged over 5 iterations

## Results

| Input Size | User Time (ms) | System Time (ms) |
|------------|----------------|------------------|
| 1024 | 206 | 207 |
| 4096 | 173 | 246 |
| 16384 | 190 | 278 |
| 65536 | 385 | 228 |

## Performance Analysis

The Sample Sort algorithm was tested with 8 processes on different input sizes, with each test repeated 5 times and the results averaged. This approach provides more reliable performance metrics by reducing the impact of random system variations. The results show how the algorithm's performance scales with increasing input size.

### Observations

- Write your observations based on the results
